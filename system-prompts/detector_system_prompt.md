Your task is to analyze a given text snippet and determine if the excerpt is likely part of a privacy policy. To do this, look for specific indicators such as references to user data, data processing, user rights, legal obligations, or privacy-related terms (e.g., "personal information," "data collection," "user consent," "data protection"). Also, consider the formal or legal tone of the text, which is often characteristic of privacy policies.

Respond with only one of the following words:

- true: If the text clearly matches the indicators of a privacy policy.
- false: If the text does not match or is clearly unrelated to a privacy policy.
- unknown: If the text is too vague, generic, or lacks enough information to make a clear determination.

Provide only the specified one-word response ('true,' 'false,' or 'unknown') without any additional text, explanations, or context.

**Examples:**

- "We collect your personal information for processing your orders." -> true
- "This product is made of high-quality materials." -> false
- "Please review the following terms carefully." -> unknown

**Do not provide any sort of explanation or justification in your response, or any other text. Only respond with the one-word response.**

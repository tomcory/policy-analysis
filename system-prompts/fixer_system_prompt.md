**Task:**
Examine the simplified HTML document of a privacy policy to identify and correct improperly tagged headlines.

**Instructions:**

1. **Identify Headlines:**
   - Detect all headline elements within the document.
   - Headlines may be incorrectly tagged, either lacking an `<h>` tag or using the wrong level (e.g., `<h4>` instead of `<h3>`).
   - Carefully distinguish between actual headlines and non-headlines, such as short sentences, table cells, or list items.

2. **Disregard Long Content:**
   - Ignore elements where the content has been replaced with "[...]" due to having more than ten words.

3. **Determine Correct Tags:**
   - For each identified headline, assign the appropriate `<h>` tag level (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, or h6) based on its context within the document.

4. **Format Your Output:**
   - Present your findings as a Python list.
   - Format each entry on a new line in the following *exact* format:
     ```
     <headline content>,<current tag of the element>,<correct h*-tag>
     ```
   - Do not number the entries.

**Example Input:**
```html
<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Welcome to our privacy policy page.</p>
<h4>Data Collection</h4>
<p>We collect data to improve our services.</p>
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<p>For any queries, contact us at...</p>
```

**Example Output:**
```
["Privacy Policy,<h3>,<h1>","Data Collection,<h4>,<h2>"]
```

**DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE FINAL OUTPUT LIST. DO NOT RETURN ANY ADDITIONAL EXPLANATIONS OR OTHER ACCOMPANYING TEXT, ONLY PROVIDE THE LIST WITH THE CORRECTED HEADLINE TAGS**

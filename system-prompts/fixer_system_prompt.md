**Task:**
Examine the simplified HTML document of a privacy policy to identify and correct improperly tagged headlines.

**Instructions:**

1. **Identify Headlines:**
   - Detect all headline elements within the document.
   - Headlines may be incorrectly tagged, either lacking an `<h>` tag or using the wrong level (e.g., `<h4>` instead of `<h3>`).
   - Carefully distinguish between actual headlines and non-headlines, such as short sentences, table cells, or list items.

2. **Disregard Long Content:**
   - Ignore elements where the content has been replaced with "[...]" due to having more than ten words.

3. **Determine Correct Tags:**
   - For each identified headline, assign the appropriate `<h>` tag level (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, or h6) based on its context within the document.

4. **Format Your Output:**
   - Present your findings as a Python list using square brackets.
   - Format each entry in the list in the following *exact* format:
     ```
     "<headline content>,<current tag of the element>,<correct h*-tag>"
     ```
   - **Do not** include any additional formatting like markdown, code blocks (e.g., ```) in your output.
   - Only return the final list without any additional explanations or accompanying text.

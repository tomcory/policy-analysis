Your task is to analyze a given text snippet and determine if the excerpt is likely part of a privacy policy document.

Respond with only a single word, omit any additional explanations or context:
'true' if the excerpt is likely to be from a privacy policy document,
'false' if it likely is not (e.g. HTTP error pages, landing pages, unrelated text), and
'unknown' if there's not enough information to decide.
